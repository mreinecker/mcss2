                        years.

                        will
                        only settle if you are satisfied with the proposed result.

                <div id="workers-comp" class="col s12 grey lighten-4">
                    <h5>Worker's Compensation</h5>
                    <p>The New Jersey Worker’s Compensation Act, if you are injured on the job you have the right to
                        medical
                        treatment and temporary disability benefits while you are out of work paid for by the employer’s
                        Worker’s Compensation carrier.</p>
                    <p>While you need to request authorization for treatment, insurance carriers all too often now have
                        only two purposes in mind: stop you from getting legitimate treatment and return you to work
                        no matter what so they can stop paying benefits. Also, some employers try to deny that you were
                        injured on the job to avoid making a claim. But you do not have to take their answer as the
                        final
                        say. Kevin Kovacs has been helping injured workers for over 30 years obtain the benefits they
                        are entitled to receive, and going to Court if necessary to get an Order to Compel employers
                        and insurance carriers to abide by the Law and provide those benefits, at no cost to you.</p>
                    <p>Also, if you are injured on the job, you have the right to obtain a monetary award to compensate
                        you for the extent of the permanent disability you have suffered. Kevin will use his skill and
                        experience to get you the best result and if your case cannot settle for fair value he is
                        prepared
                        to take it to Trial. The award he obtains for you will help offset the losses you suffered and
                        will also serve to extend the time when you can seek further treatment if your condition gets
                        worse. The cost to you is nothing up front and nothing if Kevin is not successful on your
                        behalf.
                        The Court will award Kevin fees representing a small portion of the money he obtains for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>So if you are injured on the job and need help navigating the complex and all too often
                        frustrating
                        system, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>

                    <h5>Employment Law</h5>
                    <p>Kevin is somewhat unique in the world of employment law. Over the course of his 30-year career he
                        has represented both sides in such claims: employers and employees, and still does.</p>
                    <p>Kevin has represented Fortune 500 companies, and mid and small-sized businesses successfully fend
                        off claims of discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful discharge. Also, he fights
                        for the wronged employee to obtain just compensation and punitive damages where warranted.</p>
                    <p>Kevin understands the law and the dynamics of an employment law case, which sometimes gets very
                        personal.
                        Kevin knows how to identify the issues, investigate and learn the facts and present your case
                        with true insight on how to achieve a successful result.</p>
                    <p>So if you are a small or mid-sized business faced with a claim of discrimination, harassment,
                        retaliation
                        or wrongful discharge or just want a consultation before making a personnel decision that may
                        lead to such a claim, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at
                        Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you are an officer, manager or employee of a company being separated from
                        employment,
                        or the victim of discrimination, retaliation or harassment or if you are subject to a
                        non-compete
                        agreement and have questions, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at
                        Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>
